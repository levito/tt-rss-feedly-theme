tt-rss-feedly-theme
===================

**Caution: This branch only works until tt-rss commit [f679ec2](https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/tt-rss/commit/f679ec2e6e25598c511177d7d160c51d2bdf631e)! Later commits include a new dojo base theme and will break badly!**

Feedly theme for [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://git.tt-rss.org/git/tt-rss/wiki) 1.15 or newer.

Use the [legacy branch](https://github.com/levito/tt-rss-feedly-theme/tree/legacy) for TT-RSS 1.11 or older.

Use the [branch v1.12](https://github.com/levito/tt-rss-feedly-theme/tree/v1.12) if you use version 1.12 up to 1.14.

For the best experience, use a current browser. IE9 and older versions are not supported.

This theme is tested in Chrome on a regular basis and should work fine in IE10 and recent versions of Safari, Firefox (28+) and Opera (15+) as well.
